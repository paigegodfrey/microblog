# Microblog

Microblog is a simple app that allows users to create/modify blog posts and add/delete comments. The app uses Redux and Redux Thunk to manage state, handle prop-drilling, and dispatch actions asynchronously.

The frontend is built with React and styled with Bootstrap, and the backend runs on Node/Express and uses a PostgreSQL database.
