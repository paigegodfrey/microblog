# Microblog

Microblog is a simple app in which users can create/modify blog posts and leave comments. The app uses Redux and Redux Thunk to manage state, handle prop-drilling, and dispatch actions asynchronously.

The frontend is built with React and styled with Bootstrap, while the backend is built with Node/Express and uses a PostgreSQL database.
